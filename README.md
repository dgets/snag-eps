# snag-eps

Just a little shell script that will automate snagging of multiple episodes of a series that has sequential similar filenames from a web host.  I may end up adding support for ftp protocol and directory mirroring at some point.  It'd also be nice to have some sed work that'll handle things so that we only need one complete URL.  Can't be too hard to construct them from that.
