The key that puts this all together is in the search string that was provided
to me by a tantrum-throwing asshole a few years ago here.  Pick whatever
the media is that you're looking for (though not something copyrighted, as in
this example-- it's _strictly_ for example), say **Fargo** _Season 3_.  The 
only part of the following string that you will need to edit, to find what 
you're looking for, is the quoted part of the following:

	`-inurl:(htm|html|asp) intitle:index (mpg|mp4|avi|mkv) "fargo s03"`

Toss it into google for a good time.

Enjoy.
